# TornikeO's guide on fullstack development

## Who is this guide for
Someone who wants to:
- to publish their work online, as website or an API
- know how to find a low cost alternatives when hosting a website

## Tools + how to test if you know one
- You need a way ship **all** dependencies of an app, with the app. Including the OS itself:
    - Tools:
        - Docker, and docker compose
    - Test yourself:
        - Easy: 
            - Run [ubuntu image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) locally
            - Connect to the ubuntu instance and create a file named "new.txt" at the root
            - Copy that file to your host system
        - Medium:
            - Create new git repo. Add `docker-compose.yml` file. Two services, one with python (or any other language) and other with database (any database).
            - Connect one container with the other. Update the database with the language.
        - Hard:
            - Create an alpine python dockerfile.
            - Add `git` to the container, using a multistage build.
- Creating the UI:
    - Tools:
        - Svelte, Sveltekit (Or any other JS framework, as long as you **don't** know how to work with it in advance.)
    - Test yourself:
        - Easy:
            - (Bonus) Create nodejs docker enviornment, and start working there
            - Follow official guide of that framework to create a simple *static* website.
        - Medium:
            - Deploy the website as a `github pages` application.
        - Hard:
            - Do the deployment to `github pages` in a single command (you might be able to find an npm package that does this)
            - Redeploy the static website as an `aws s3 static website`. Follow the official aws guide for this.
- Creating the backend:
    - Tools:
        - Python, NodeJS or Java (For hard mode, use a language that you don't primarily work with)
    - Test yourself:
        - Easy:
            - (Bonus) Create a docker backend enviornment, and start working there
            - Choose a backend framework for the language
            - Find and the official guide creating a simple `echo service` for that framework, using that language
        - Medium:
            - Create database container, and save something within the database
        - Hard:
            - Do all the above using a language you don't work with everyday. Track the time you spent on this. Try to complete all this within 1-2 hours. Be careful and don't spend time staring at the screen, instead, read the docs or choose another framework/approach. 
- Hosting:
    - Tools:
        - Google cloud and aws:
    - Test yourself:
        - Easy:
            - AWS:
                - Manually upload a file to s3 storage (using web UI).
                - Create a python script that uploads 5 images to the s3 storage (creating a bucket if it doesn't exist yet).
            - GCloud:
                - Manually upload a file to gcloud storage (using web UI).
                - Install gcloud cli, auth, and upload a folder to a gcloud bucket (check the docs for this)
            - In both cases:
                - Make the download URL available publicly (test out the download with a private browser window)
        - Medium:
            - AWS:
                - Create a lambda service, using aws web UI. Query the lambda service using the language of your choice.
                - Create lambda service, using a container. You'd have to:
                    - Create dockerfile.
                    - Create an aws elastic container repository (ECR) using web UI
                    - Use upload your docker image to ECR.
                    - Use web ui to deploy container to ECR. Make sure to follow and the AWS guide on this (aws container on lambda).
            - GCloud:
                - Create `gcloud run` container service in a single line (hint: `gcloud run deploy ...`), make sure to conform to container restrictions.
            - In both cases query the service to get the expected outputs.
